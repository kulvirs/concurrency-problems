# Overview

This repository contains solutions to five different problems from the [Little Book of Semaphores](http://greenteapress.com/semaphores/LittleBookOfSemaphores.pdf): 
- Producer-consumer (with a finite buffer)
- Dining Philosophers
- Dining Savages
- Barbershop
- Unisex Bathrooms  

The solutions are implemented in Python and Go. Two different solutions are presented for each problem along with an analysis that compares and contrasts the two approaches with respect to correctness, comprehensibility, and performance. A sixth problem of my own making, queue, is also included.     

## System Specifications
The languages used were Python 3.6 and Go 1.11.  
The programs were run on Windows 10 when gathering results.
